# Color Me Honest! Time Pressure and Dis(honest) Behavior

Our study introduced several modifications to the traditional die-in-a-cup experiment to explore honest and dishonest behavior under varying time pressures. By substituting the regular die with a custom-colored one and using a dice tower instead of a cup, we aimed to manipulate the participant's familiarity with the decision situation. Additionally, we captured mouse cursor trajectories to gain deeper insights into the decision-making process. Our preregistered laboratory experiment, involving 229 subjects, indicates that the type of die used influences honesty reports under time pressure. Furthermore, mouse tracking analysis revealed significant differences in initiation times among different types of liars.
